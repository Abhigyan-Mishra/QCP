        <h2>Quantum Computing Playground</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Quantum Computing Playground is a browser-based WebGL Chrome Experiment.
        It features a GPU-accelerated quantum computer with a simple IDE interface,
        and its own scripting language with debugging and 3D quantum state visualization features.
        Quantum Computing Playground can efficiently simulate quantum registers up to 22 qubits,
        run Grover's and Shor's algorithms, and has a variety of quantum gates
        built into the scripting language itself.

    <div class="page-header"><h3>How do quantum computers work?</h3></div>
    <p>
      A classic computer processes bits, which at any given time can be in one of two states:
      0 or 1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computer">Quantum computers</a>
      use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit">qubits</a>,
      which can exist in any superposition of states 0 and 1, and are
      represented by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number">complex number</a>.
      When N qubits are in superposition, a combination of 2^N states is created.
      A classic computer can only hold one of these states at a time,
      while quantum computers can perform meaningful operations on superpositions of states.
      This basic property of quantum computers opens a way to multiple
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_algorithms">interesting algorithms</a>.
    </p>
    <div class="page-header"><h3>How do you program a quantum computer?</h3></div>
    <p>
      The most basic operations performed on qubits are defined by quantum gates, similar to
      logical gates used in classic computers. Using
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gate">quantum gates</a> one can build
      complex algorithms, usually ending in a measurement operation, which obtains
      a classical value of qubits (either 0 or 1, but not a superposition).
      The state of a quantum computer, a set of qubits called quantum register,
      can be visualized in a <a href="" ng-click="loadAbout()">number of ways</a>,
      typically as a 2D or 3D graph,
      on which points or bars represent superpositions of qubits, while their
      color or bar height represent amplitude and phase of a given superposition.
      An interesting property of quantum gates is their reversibility, allowing
      for program execution both forward and in reverse without any side-effects.

    <div class="page-header"><h3>Where can I buy a real quantum computer?</h3></div>
    <p>
      As of today the only company selling quantum computers is
      <a href="http://www.dwavesys.com">D-Wave</a>, but unfortunately their architecture does not
      perform arbitrary quantum gate operations on sequences of qubits (which is what
      Quantum Computing Playground simulates at this time).
      The proof-of-concepts for capabilities of quantum computing
      have been demonstrated in multiple laboratories around the world though, so there is a chance
      that quantum computers will become one day everydayâ€™s reality.
      For now, you can experience the technology of tomorrow today, inside our Playground.
